# Pixel_Video_Editor

This is an abandoned project. It is/was more of a passion project, but I recently became too busy to continue working on it. I might come back to it in a later time. If you are interested in the project, contact me. I will probably eventually license the source code as open source, especially if there is interest, and I would also be glad to provide instructions/ clarifications or even spend some time on developing if peple think about continuing the work.

This is a software that allows the creation of animations, by combining images and existing animations. It is focused on pixel art.
The user needs to use existing images, as the software does not support image editing.
The main feature of the application is the concept of "clips": A clip can be an image/spritesheet (basic clip), a text (text clip) or a complex clip, which combines/references other clips (basic, text, or complex clips) to create complex animations.
The application features a traditional frame and layer system for animation, and clip references.
The goal is to allow the user to create animations, allow reusing the created animations to make new animations, and also allow the user to modify animations (or images through external software) without needing to change all the relevant frames where these changes take place. This is achieved through the "reference" system, where a complex clip consists of references to other clips (so when a clip or image change, all references are automatically "changed" too without needing to manually update the relevant frames.)

Currently there is no functionality to export the created clips to gif or any other format. A playback feature is also not yet implemented.

Apart from the above, future plans also included the creation of "audio clips", which would allow the user to create full- fledged pixel art movies, with images, subtitles (text clips) and audio.

Further instructions and tutorial might be provided at a later time, when I am less busy. Thanks for reading!
